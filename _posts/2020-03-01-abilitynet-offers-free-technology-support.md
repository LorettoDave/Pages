As a registered charity [AbilityNet](https://www.abilitynet.org.uk/) exists to change the lives of older people and people with a disability by helping them to use digital technology. They are supported by IBM and Microsoft.

The free helpline 0800 269 545 is available for advice and information. They also have a nationwide network of 280 carefully selected and vetted AbilityNet ITCanHelp volunteers (including myself) who can visit clients in their own homes and support them with their technology. 

As well as diagnosing and fixing most computer related problems, their ITCanHelp volunteers can help with sending and receiving emails, using the internet, installing new hardware and software, and giving impartial advice on IT equipment and software.    

If this is something that you or anyone you come into contact with might benefit from, they would welcome hearing from you. 

If you would like to chat further about their service, call them on 0800 269 545 or email [enquiries@abilitynet.org.uk](mailto:enquiries@abilitynet.org.uk). For more information visit [https://www.abilitynet.org.uk/at-home](https://www.abilitynet.org.uk/at-home).
