A slow computer is usually caused by a slow hard drive. From £125, a Windows PC with a 500GB drive can be updated to run significantly faster by upgrading to a solid-state drive (SSD). 

Until recently, nearly every computer was built using a standard hard drive which uses magnetic heads to read and write data on spinning metal platters. Such hard drives can read data at a maximum rate of 120 megabytes per second (MB/s) under ideal conditions, and that rate is usually much slower under normal conditions.

A solid-state drive has no moving parts; it’s essentially a large amount of special computer memory that remembers its contents even when the computer is turned off. These drives are very fast, achieving data read rates of around 500 MB/s—four or five times faster than standard hard drives— under normal conditions.

In most cases, we can upgrade a computer to an SSD in less than two hours. To see if your PC can be upgraded, call or email Computer Help Northern Ireland. We’ll be happy to discuss your options and provide a quote free of charge.
