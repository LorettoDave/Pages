Microsoft Windows 10 runs well on most PCs or laptops built during the past 10 years, usually *much better* than Windows 7 or 8/8.1. It also has excellent security features built-in, making it possible to ditch those third-party antivirus packages while still protecting your computer from infections. With a solid-state drive and at least 2GB of RAM, most any computer will run well on Windows 10. For details about solid-state drives, see our blog post [Don't replace your old computer, upgrade it!]({% post_url 2019-08-10-dont-replace-your-old-computer-upgrade-it %})

In addition to better performance, another good reason to upgrade to Windows 10 is that Microsoft is ending support for its older operating systems. They no longer support Windows XP at all, meaning any new security issues found in XP will not be patched. Windows 7 is approaching the end of its 'extended support' phase as well, so it will no longer receive security updates after 14 January, 2020. For details of how Microsoft supports its older operating systems, see this article by Chris Hoffman: [How Long Will Microsoft Support My Version of Windows with Security Updates?](https://www.howtogeek.com/308290/how-long-will-microsoft-support-my-version-of-windows-with-security-updates/)
